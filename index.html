                <li>nobody has "20 years of experience" out of college.</li>

            colleges are trending towards raising the mean GPA of their students,

          <br />
          universities were propped up because information was sacred and
          unbelievably hard to find. but now, some really prestigious topics,
          crafts and fields are being converted to trades that can be trained
          on the internet.

              </a>
              <span class="highlight">georgiana mihut</span>
              ran an experiment with sending different types of template resumes to employers and found
              that applications in the high skills match condition were <span class="highlight">79% more likely to
                receive a callback</span> than
              applications in the low skills match condition and that college prestige was not statistically significant
              (mihut). this demonstrates that college prestige is trending towards obsolescence, with having the actual
              skills for the job being much more important than where one graduated from. if one is able to build those
              skills independently, then it shows how much university credentials are starting to matter less over time.

                <h1>inflation</h1>
              </a>
              not only is inflation prevalent, <span class="highlight">disfiguring the credibility of gpa and
                grades</span>, but because it’s
              more likely in weather schools means that either wealthier students are treated in higher regards due to
              their gpa or lower-income students are burdened with the stigmas of gpa inflation which they aren’t
              affected by. in either case, the lower-income students lose. this class disparity demonstrates the
              unfairness and crumbling of our education system, which indeed, might discourage newer employers from
              looking at gpa altogether.

              <span class="highlight">the decay of meaningful credentials</span> of education may seem grim, what choice are lower-class “students”
              left with if education isn’t even reliable enough to get a job?

              <span class="highlight">degree requirements completely being thrown out</span>
              seems extreme, but as evident in previous studies, a reality with accredation programs being more valuable
              than degrees is already slowly being realized. furthermore,
              if the future entails non-degree certification programs to grant degrees, then class mobility will see a
              revolution as the money and time needed for a university degree is no longer needed to prove you actually
              know or have a skill. in this future, everyone with an ability to do something will be able to do
              something with that ability thereby basing class only on one’s ability.
